#### 1) **What is !important property in CSS?**
The !important property in CSS is used to provide more weight (importance) than normal property. In CSS, the !important means that “this is important”, ignore all the subsequent rules, and apply !important rule and the !important keyword must be placed at the end of the line, immediately before the semicolon. 
#### Syntax:
```
    element {
        color: blue  !important;
        font-size: 14px !important; 
        ...
    }
```
#### 2) **Static versus Dynamic Typing, What is type of JavaScript?**

Static typed programming languages are those in which variables need to be defined before they’re used. This implies that static typing has to do with the explicit declaration (or initialization) of variables before they’re employed. Java is an example of a static typed language; C and C++ are also static typed languages.

```
/* C code */ 
static int num, sum; // explicit declaration 
num = 5; // now use the variables 
sum = 10; 
sum = sum + num;
```

Dynamic typed programming languages are those languages in which variables need not be defined before they are used. This implies that dynamic typed languages do not require the explicit declaration of the variables before they’re used. Ruby is an example of a dynamic typed programming language

```
/* Ruby code */ 
num = 10 // directly using the variable
```
Javascript is dynamically typed programming language.
#### 3) **CSS Box Model**
All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.
The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.
#### Syntax:
```
div {
  width: 300px;
  border: 15px solid green;
  padding: 50px;
  margin: 20px;
}
```
#### 4) **Closures in JS**
A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives us access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function. 
In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

#### 5) **CSS Inheritance**
In CSS, inheritance controls what happens when no value is specified for a property on an element.
CSS properties can be categorized in two types:

* Inherited properties, which by default are set to the computed value of the parent element
* Non-inherited properties, which by default are set to initial value of the property



#### 6) **Difference between puts, print, p in ruby**
The 'puts' (short for "put string") and 'print' commands are both used to display the results of evaluating Ruby code. 
Both 'puts' and 'print' call the 'to_s' method on the object AND return nil.
The primary difference between them is that 'puts' adds a newline after executing, and 'print' does not.They don't RETURN anything so the RETURN value is nil.
Using 'p' calls the 'inspect' method on the object.
#### Example
```
print "Hello"
Hello => nil

puts "Hello"
Hello
=> nil

p "Hello"
"Hello"
=> "Hello"
```
```
3.times { print "Hello!" }
Hello!Hello!Hello!=> 3

3.times { puts "Hello!" }
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
=> 3

3.times { p "Hello!" }
"Hello!"
"Hello!"
"Hello!"
=> 3
```

#### 7) **CSS Selectors**
In CSS, selectors are patterns used to select the elements that we want to style.
These are some of the examples

| Selector    |      Example       |  Example description |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| .class |  .intro | Selects all elements with class="intro" |
| #id |    #firstname   |   Selects the element with id="firstname" |


#### 8) **How do we know type of a JS variable?**
typeof is a JavaScript keyword that will return the type of a variable when we call it. 

```
var x = 12345; 
console.log(typeof x) // number
```
#### 9) **CSS Specificity numbers**
If there are two or more conflicting CSS rules that point to the same element, the browser follows some rules to determine which one is most specific and therefore wins out.
We need to think of specificity as a score/rank that determines which style declarations are ultimately applied to an element.
The universal selector (*) has low specificity, while ID selectors are highly specific.
#### 10) **Monkey patching in Ruby**
In Ruby, a Monkey Patch (MP) is any dynamic modification to a class and is often used as a synonym for dynamically modifying any class (add new or overwrite existing methods) at runtime. 
Classes that have been Monkey Patched are more difficult to understand and debug. If we are  not careful, the error message that we receive will likely give a very little clue as to what the problem actually is.
